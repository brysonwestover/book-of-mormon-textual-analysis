## Prompt Text

```
Compare the stylistic features of two claimed authors from the Book of Mormon.

AUTHOR A: [NAME]
Sample passages: [PASSAGES]

AUTHOR B: [NAME]
Sample passages: [PASSAGES]

TASK: Analyze whether these passages exhibit distinct authorial voices or stylistic uniformity.

ANALYSIS DIMENSIONS:

1. QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON
   - Sentence length distribution
   - Vocabulary overlap
   - Function word frequencies
   - Syntactic pattern frequencies

2. QUALITATIVE COMPARISON
   - Distinctive phrases or expressions
   - Rhetorical style differences
   - Thematic emphasis differences
   - Emotional register differences

3. SHARED FEATURES
   - Common phrases appearing in both
   - Similar syntactic constructions
   - Shared theological formulations
   - Common narrative conventions

4. CALIBRATION CONTEXT
   Consider how these differences/similarities compare to:
   - Variation within a single author's work
   - Variation between known different authors
   - Variation between characters in known single-author fiction

OUTPUT FORMAT:

## Cross-Author Comparison: [Author A] vs. [Author B]

### Summary Assessment
[2-3 sentence summary of distinctiveness findings]

### Quantitative Findings
[Specific measurements with citations]

### Qualitative Findings
[Observed differences with examples]

### Shared Features
[Common elements with examples]

### Distinctiveness Rating
[Scale: Highly Distinctive / Moderately Distinctive / Low Distinctiveness / Indistinguishable]

### Interpretation Under Each Hypothesis

**Hypothesis A (Ancient Origin):**
[How would proponents interpret these findings?]
- If distinctive: [explanation]
- If uniform: [explanation, e.g., editorial homogenization]

**Hypothesis B (19th-Century Origin):**
[How would proponents interpret these findings?]
- If distinctive: [explanation, e.g., skilled character creation]
- If uniform: [explanation]

### Most Parsimonious Interpretation
[Which interpretation requires fewer auxiliary assumptions?]

### Confidence Level
[High/Moderate/Low/Indeterminate]

### Caveats
- Sample size considerations
- Genre differences between passages
- Editorial layer effects
- Translation process effects
- Limitations of this comparison method
```

## Expected Output Format
Structured comparison following the template above.

## Notes
- Prioritize comparisons between authors claimed to be from different time periods
- Note when comparing original authors vs. abridged sections
- Consider running multiple pairwise comparisons for systematic coverage
