abstract: >-
  Run-aggregated stylometric analysis of Book of Mormon narrator segments
  addressing pseudoreplication concerns. Uses blocked permutation testing
  to account for narrator-book collinearity. Primary analysis (N=12 runs,
  3-class classification) yields null result (p=0.51), indicating no
  detectable narrator-specific stylistic signal beyond book-level structure.
