THE 


BOOK OF MORMON: 


A REPRODUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL 
AS PRINTED IN 1830 By E. B. GRANDIN, 
In PALMYRA, NY. 


This reproduction has been prepared so that anyone looking to read the original 
Book of Mormon (BoM)- ~comple te with its numerous spelling, grammatical, and 
contextual errors— may do so in a modern searchable format, free of the OCR-type 
errors that, unfortunately, plague scans of old documents and books. This PDF 
ebook has been carefully compared to, and formatted as per, scans of the original 
1830 Palmyra first e dition. 


Great efforts have been made to preserve the look and feel of the original book, which 
is why this PDF ebook is sized to match the dimensions of the original. The 
formatting and typeset used in this PDF is a close approximation to that of the 
original book. Though a modern font was used and the spacing is not identical, 
the text, page breaks, word wrapping and numbering remain the same. It is my 
hope that this PDF will be a valuable resource for all those who are in need of an 
accurate and modern copy of the first edition of The Book of Mormon with which 
to compare the current edition being published by the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints.
